fs/promise is package which helps us to create foolder and files and remove and addd them
await fs.writeFile(path.join(currentDir, target), "");
If the file doesn't exist, it creates it
If it exists, it overwrites it (like UNIX touch)
Adds no content ("")

unlink is the Node method for deleting files


path.resolve builds the new absolute path
fs.stat checks if it's actually a directory
Then we update currentDir for future commands
